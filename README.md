                                                                                                                                      This project uses ResNet18, a deep residual network, to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). The model is trained using Python and deep learning frameworks, showcasing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions. This work highlights the power of residual connections in improving accuracy and mitigating vanishing gradients in deep networks.
